      <h2><u>What are we aiming at?</u></h2>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="justify">The Prosperity Circles initiative aims to make a tangible impact on poverty by leveraging the collective efforts of individuals and businesses.<br>
         It provides a structured and organized approach to giving back and enables people to contribute to causes they are passionate about. <br>
         By connecting users with reputable nonprofits and focusing on collaborative projects, the platform can address immediate needs while also <br>
         fostering sustainable solutions. The idea aligns with my commitment to social responsibility and my desire to make a positive difference in the lives of those facing poverty. <br>
         Before proceeding, I will seek my lecturer's approval to ensure the feasibility and potential impact of the Prosperity Circles initiative.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>What is the issue?</u></h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="justify">Poverty is a multifaceted challenge characterized by lacking necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. It encompasses issues such as inadequate education, <br>
          limited employment opportunities, gender inequality, and social exclusion. Impoverished individuals and communities often face health disparities, environmental vulnerability, <br>
          and a cycle of generational poverty. Discrimination and marginalization can further exacerbate the effects of poverty, particularly among vulnerable groups. Addressing poverty necessitates <br>
          comprehensive strategies that encompass education, healthcare, social safety nets, and economic development, along with efforts to raise awareness and advocate for policy changes that <br>
          promote equitable opportunities and improved living conditions for all.</p>

        <h2><u>Why is there so much poverty in the world?</u></h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="justify"> Poverty has multiple root causes beyond just a lack of basic necessities like food, shelter, education, or healthcare. Discrimination based on gender or ethnicity,<br>
           poor governance, conflict, exploitation, and domestic violence are all factors that contribute to this. These inequities trap people and communities in poverty, and limit access to social<br>
            services that could help people overcome it. Fragile contexts, which can be entire countries or regions, tend to be the most entrenched. Political instability, past or present conflicts, <br>
            corrupt leaders, and poor infrastructure limit access to necessities people need to thrive.<br><br>
            Poverty can be a trap that is difficult to escape. Without opportunities for clean water, healthcare, education, and financial resources, it can turn into a cycle that persists for generations.<br>
            When families lack the means to send their children to school, their children struggle to earn an income as adults. When communities lack access to clean water, women and girls spend many hours each day gathering water, <br>
            leaving little time for school or a livelihood. When medical facilities are far away, families lose income if they take time off work to care for sick loved ones.<br>
            Natural disasters and conflict can exacerbate this cycle, putting vulnerable communities at even greater risk. When natural disasters strike in areas without strong public institutions, families may lack the resources to recover, thus further entrenching them in poverty.</p>
